We have two structures, the first is Dependences, the second structure is Relation .
There are three functions(3 normal forms):
***FN1*** if we have a key in a relation then we say that this relation is in FN1.
Example:
R( A , B ,C ) is a relation , A is a key, so we say that R is in FN1.


*****************
***FN2*** we say that the reletion is in FN2 if :
-The relation is in the FN1.
-A part of a key don't determine another attribute.
Example:
R( A , B ,C ,D ) is a relation . The key of this reletion is AB.
The functional dependencies are:

AB ==> C
B ==> D

This relation is in FN1 because it has a key but it's not in FN2 because we have B ==> D (B is a part of a key.)

*****************
***FN3*** we say that the reletion is in FN3 if :
-The relation is in the FN2.
-We don't have a transitivity between functional dependencies.
Example:
R( A , B ,C ,D ) is a relation . The key of this reletion is AB.
The functional dependencies are:

AB ==> C
C ==> D

This relation is in FN1 because it has a key ,and it's in FN2 ,but it'is not in FN3 because we have a transitivity.
